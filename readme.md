## GitHub Approval of Pull Requests

When you've made changes to the code on your personal branch, commit it and
push it to GitHub. From there, go onto your branch on the GitHub repo and
submit a pull request. Select the base to be branch below yours, add any
comments and click submit.

This new request may need some approval of your co-workers to add the new code
to the branch below yours. If this is the case, then they can find the new
request in the "Pull Requests" tab on the main page of the repo.

On this tab, there will be an option to add a review. Here, you can add a
comment to the request, suggest changes to the code or approve the pull. Once
enough people have approved the pull, then the person who originally made the
request will be able to complete the pull, if there are no conflicts with the
merge.

### Pull Before Merging
When wanting to make a merge to a lower branch, you should pull from that
branch onto yours before then merging and pushing the changes to GitHub. This
will help prevent mrge conflicts that can cause some problems if left
unchecked.
